          Considering these complexities, there arises a critical need for a smarter solution—one that not only simplifies the application process but also addresses the systemic issues of financial exclusion and socio-economic disparity. Such an app would not only streamline university applications but also offer comprehensive support mechanisms to mitigate the challenges faced by South African matric learners, ensuring equitable access to higher education without compromising their well-being or perpetuating historical injustices.

              <h4>Problem 1</h4>
              <p>
                The challenges faced by South African matric learners during the university application process are profound. Recognizing that the matric year is a critical period marked by intense academic focus, it becomes imperative to alleviate unnecessary burdens.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h4>Problem 2</h4>
              <p>
                Despite existing platforms attempting to simplify the application process, many inadvertently exacerbate these challenges. Consequently, matric students find themselves resorting to universities' premises in search of study spaces, adding undue stress to an already demanding period.

              <h4>Problem 3</h4>
              <p>
                Compounding these difficulties are the financial constraints experienced by registered students, particularly those hailing from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

              <h4>Problem 4</h4>
              <p>
                Insufficient funding often leads to financial exclusions, triggering national student strikes characterized by contentious conflicts between universities and students. Tragically, these confrontations can escalate to the point of violence, echoing the harrowing events of 1976.
