        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This Non-Refundable Payment Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("User") and MMS HIGH TECH ("Company") regarding the non-refundable nature of payments made for subscriptions, purchases, and other services through the Netchatsa app ("App"). By making a payment through the App, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.</p>

        <h2>1. Non-Refundable Payments</h2>
        <p>All payments made through the App are final and non-refundable. This includes but is not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Subscription fees</li>
            <li>In-app purchases</li>
            <li>Other one-time charges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Subscription Services</h2>
        <p>If you purchase a subscription, you will be billed at the start of your subscription and on a recurring basis thereafter. You may cancel your subscription at any time, but please note that any payments already made are non-refundable.</p>

        <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Any purchases made within the App, including virtual goods, are final and non-refundable. Ensure you review your purchase carefully before completing the transaction.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Application Fees</h2>
        <p>Fees in the App are not application fees. These are non-refundable administrative fees. Application fees may be requested by tertiary institutions and may be payable to those institutions directly, not through the App. We do not claim any application fees.</p>

        <h2>4. Study Content Fees</h2>
        <p>Study content on the App may not be owned by the App nor the Company. Therefore, we do not charge nor sell the content. All payable fees on study materials are not charges from the content nor paying for the content on the App but app admin service fee.</p>

        <h2>5. Chargebacks</h2>
        <p>Attempting to initiate a chargeback through your credit card provider or payment service is a violation of this Agreement. If we determine that you have initiated a chargeback, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App and pursue any available legal remedies.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Agreement</h2>
        <p>We may update this Agreement from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Agreement on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
